# Tracking some TODO items that are not a priority
- [] Fix timestamp parsing in [beast.go](.internal/models/beast.go)
- [] Add more parsing of message body, try to get flight call sign so that you can get flights not just aircraft seen
- [] Emergency or other interesting code alerts, could we email if we detect anything like that?
- [] Tracking for a particular plane. 
- [] Need a way to purge Aircraft table if we want to update the information.
